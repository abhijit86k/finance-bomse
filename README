A PERL Module to fetch stock quotes for indian stocks, developed for use
with Gnucash. Quotes are picked from Yahoo finance in JSON format
and then parsed.

The files here are intended to replace and augment those that come with the
PERL Finance::Quote package (usually located in /usr/share/perl5/Finance)

Code here is based on the BSERO module for Romanian stocks documented here:
http://www.strainu.ro/projects/bse-stock-prices-in-gnucash/

Requires JSON and Datetime modules installed for Perl

Installation:
-------------
Look at the commands in install.sh. Basically the following needs to be done:
Add "BOMSE" to the list of available methods in Quote.pm (located by default in
something like /usr/share/perl5/Finance directory.

Other useful stuff:
